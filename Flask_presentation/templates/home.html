                            <h2>Analyzing concentration of Unemployment in US states and counties</h2>
                            <p>In this final project our team has decided to analyze unemployment data in US states and counties, we wanted to see which states and counties has most unemployment rate. Question we hope to answer is 'which state/county has
                                the most unemployed population', with the given features in the data-set can we predict the unemployment for those states and counties.</p>

                            <p>The BLS data show that the nation's three largest cities LA, New York and Chicago have unemployment rates dramatically higher than the national average of 5.9 percent in last year. Reason we choose this topic is our curiosity
                                about the “great resignation”, and what percentage of labor force is actually unemployed and not contributing to the country’s economy.</p>

                            <p>Overall outline of this analysis is getting employment ,demographic data and education data, clean ,merge and upload the data into a database and create a machine model, visualizations and interactive maps to see the results.</p>

                            <p>Team members are assigned specific roles each week in this project, we all work together on all parts of the project. we meet via zoom twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays (6 or 6.30pm Arizona time) to discuss ideas and responsibilities.
                                We use slack every day to communicate ideas and changes made to repository.In our team to avoid git issues we work on our individual branch after we merge the branch to main we delete the branch from the repository.</p>

                            <h3>Data-exploration and analysis:</h3>
                            <p>Data exploration is the first step of data analysis used to explore and visualize data to uncover insights from the start or identify areas or patterns to dig into. After cleaning and uploading the data in to our database,
                                we have spent some time to explore the data , to decide whether there is any trend in the data ,what analysis will answer our question better , what story we can tell with the dataset.</p>
                            <p>Using pandas's matplotlib we analyzed the dataset, we started to see a trend that counties with most population also have more unemployment rates.Our data exploration and analysis are in the charts folder above.</p>
                            <p>Then we wanted to see if education levels impact higher unemployment rates , we have downloaded countywise education data, and built a tableau chart to see relationship between population, education and unemployment.</p>

                            <p>Data preprocessing improves the data quality by cleaning, normalizing, transforming and extracting relevant feature from raw data. Our raw data came in with columns with data type objects, the machine model we have built can
                                only take in columns with numbers, we have formatted the dataframe “features” into integer columns, dropped unwanted columns, remove null/missing values.</p>
                            <p>Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make our model work well, we have discussed which features should be
                                included and which one should be dropped.</p>
                            <p>To get more truer predictions the features should be picked carefully , However in our dataset unemployment will be more where there are more population, so we decided to add education information as a feature as well, then
                                we used race population information , education information to predict unemployed count for a choosen county.</p>
                            <p>If the model does not perform well on the unseen dataset(test) ,but gives a high score on the seen dataset , the model is overfitting, our test score is 93% ,so our random regressor model is performing well and not overfitting.</p>
